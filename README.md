# GENERATIVE-TEXT-MODEL-GPT









# 🚀 Generative Text Model using GPT

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Generative Text Model using a pre-trained GPT architecture (DistilGPT2) from HuggingFace Transformers.

The model generates coherent paragraphs based on user-provided prompts.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system capable of generating meaningful text using Transformer-based architecture.

---

## 🧠 Model Used
- DistilGPT2 (Lightweight version of GPT-2)
- Transformer Architecture
- Pre-trained on large-scale internet text

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- HuggingFace Transformers
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔄 How It Works
1. User provides a text prompt.
2. The prompt is tokenized.
3. The model predicts the next words probabilistically.
4. Tokens are decoded into readable text.
